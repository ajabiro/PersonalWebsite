        <h2>Developer</h2>
        <p>I recenty decided to make a career change into the tech industry. I am starting by taking a full 
            stack Java bootcamp course to obtain a Java certificate. I decided to get into the tech field because
            I am interested in learning something new and I know there will always be a demand for tech as we 
            become more and more technologically advanced. Another reason for joining this field is that I
             am very creative and I enjoy creating projects and see them come to life. 
        </p>
        <h2>Hometown</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Fenton Michigan. Ususally people have never heard of it, so I always have to say it 
            is located a little south of Flint. I enjoy going to downtown Fenton and walking around or going to restaurants. </p>
